/** A template trait for mutable maps of type `mutable.Map[A, B]` which
 *  associate keys of type `A` with values of type `B`.
 *
 *  @tparam A    the type of the keys.
 *  @tparam B    the type of associated values.
 *  @tparam This the type of the `Map` itself.

 *  @author  Martin Odersky
 *  @version 2.8
 *  @since 2.8
 *  @define mapnote
 *    To implement a concrete mutable map, you need to provide implementations
 *    of the following methods:
 *  {{{
 *    def get(key: A): Option[B]
 *    def iterator: Iterator[(A, B)]
 *    def += (kv: (A, B)): this.type
 *    def -= (key: A): this.type
 *  }}}
 *    If you wish that methods like `take`,
 *    `drop`, `filter` return the same kind of map, you
 *    should also override:
 *  {{{
 *    def> empty: This
 *  }}}
 *    If you wish to avoid the unncessary construction of an `Option`
 *    object, you could also override `apply`, `update`,
 *    and `delete`.

 *    It is also good idea to override methods `foreach` and
 *    `size` for efficiency.
